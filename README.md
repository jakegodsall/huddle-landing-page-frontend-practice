## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Nested Stylesheets

### What I learned

- How to change the colour of `.svg` icons by adding a filter on the image.

### Continued development

I intend to learn to use `display:grid` as I now have quite a bit of experience using flexbox, and would like to learn the other major layout system.
I believe that once I have learned the grid layout system I will be in a good enough position to start learning bootstrap and similar CSS frameworks.
